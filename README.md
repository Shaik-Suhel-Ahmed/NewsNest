NewsNest
NewsNest is a news application developed using Kotlin, designed to keep users updated with the latest top news headlines. The app uses Retrofit to fetch news from an API and follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern for a clean and maintainable code structure. To improve performance and provide offline capabilities, Room is used for local data storage.

Features :
Real-time News Updates - Fetches the latest news headlines from a reliable news API.
MVVM Architecture - Ensures a clear separation of concerns and makes the app easier to test and maintain.
Local Storage with Room - Stores top news headlines locally to provide quick access even when offline.
User-Friendly Interface - Easy-to-navigate interface with up-to-date news content.
